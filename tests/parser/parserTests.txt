# We do *not* use `functionhooks` to ensure that the extension is loaded,
# because doing that results in the entire file being skipped if the extension
# is missing, and then the test script still passes. We just assume that the
# extension is loaded - if it is missing then the test will fail which is the
# desired behavior.
